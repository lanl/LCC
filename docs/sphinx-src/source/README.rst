LCC DOCUMENTATION
===================

The folder (`src/docs`) contains all the documentation relevant to both users and
developpers.

## Prerequisites

- **[pdflatex](http://pdftex.org)**<br>
Latex GNU compiler. pdfTeX is an extension of TeX which can produce PDF directly from TeX source, as well as original DVI files. pdfTeX incorporates the e-TeX extensions.  

- **[doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)**<br>
 Doxygen  is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent PHP, C#, and D.

- **[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html)**<br> 
Sphinx is a documentation generator or a tool that translates a set of plain text source files into various output formats, automatically producing cross-references, indices, etc. That is, if you have a directory containing a bunch of reStructuredText or Markdown documents, Sphinx can generate a series of HTML files, a PDF file (via LaTeX), man pages and much more.

- Any pdf viewer.

- Any web browser. 


These programs can be installed as follows: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install pdflatex 
sudo apt-get install doxygen 
sudo apt-get install dot2tex
sudo apt-get install dot2tex
sudo apt-get install python3-sphinx
pip3 install PSphinxTheme
pip3 install recommonmark
```

## Build the full documentation
 
This will build all three types of docs (Sphinx, Doxygen, and latex)

```bash
make  
```

The documentation that is build with Sphinx can be 
tested as follows: 

```bash
firefox ccl.html
```

The file can be explored using any web browser.  

One can also build any of the documentations separatly. For example, to build 
the Sphinx documentation, we can do: 

```bash
make sphinx 
```

## Documenting 

In order to add a documentation using Sphinx follow these steps: 
1) make a file with a proper name under `./sphinx-src/source/`. For example: `MYPAGE.md`. 
2) Add the documentation inside the file using "markdown" syntax. 
3) Modify the file in `./sphinx-src/source/index.txt` to include the documentation just as shown 
in the following example:


```bash
    .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 2
      :caption: Contents:

      ./README-main
      ./README
      ./MYPAGE
```

After modyfing this file, recompile Sphinx by typing `make sphinx`.
